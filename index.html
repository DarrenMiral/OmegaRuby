					<h3 id="content">Malcolm Tsang - Student #: s3333925</h3>
					<p>Malcolm was born in Australia and is of Chinese descent.  Despite not being able to speak it, he is able to understand spoken Cantonese.  Malcolm has previously completed a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering at RMIT, and is a big sports fan – particularly of Australian Rules Football and soccer, where he supports Essendon FC and Manchester United respectively.<br><br> His interests in IT began with playing computer games against his brother and the fascination of how the technology and games constantly improved over time.  It is this innovation and constant improving technology that gets me interested into thinking what is next?  Malcolm does not yet have any relevant IT experience.</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
							<h3>Darren Miral - Student #: s3858795</h3>
							<p>Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia to Sri Lankan immigrants, Darren is undertaking his second Bachelor Degree, having previously obtained one form Monash University in 2012.  He has an intellectual curiosity regarding a number of subjects such as history, astronomy, chemistry and fine art and loves quiz shows. <br><br>Like many others, his interests in information technology stems from video games.  He feels that his enjoyment of troubleshooting, both in the context of IT and elsewhere, would be put to good use in the IT field.  Unfortunately, he has no IT experience prior to undertaking a Bachelor of IT degree from RMIT via OUA beyond building a PC and setting up a NAS on his home network to store multimedia files.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
							<h3>Connor Logan - Student #: s3768929</h3>
							<p>Connor has been studying for a number of years.  His interests include investing, video and tabletop games, fitness and singing opera songs in the shower. Despite having no real-world IT experience he is interested in becoming a full stack developer</p>
						</div>

						<div class="inner">
							<h3>Sisi Meng Shih Liu - Student #: s3855898</h3>
							<p>An Australian of Chinese origin, Sisi moved to Hong Kong and currently works as an account manager that deals with the client facing aspects of various IT financing solutions.  This occurred after beginning and then deferring a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Sydney / University of New England.  She has a keen interest in wine, so much so that she completed a level 1 course at the Asia Wine Service and Education Centre, travel running, and Korean Culture.  She is able to speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as Korean to a basic level. <br><br>She has no formal IT experience, but has worked closely with various teams for a number of years that has required some IT knowledge.  Her interest in IT was sparked by her work and a desire to be able to better understand and explain the IT aspects of her job to clients.  She hopes to one day transition into a technical related position.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="inner">
							<h3>Minh Hau Truong - Student #: s3859157</h3>
							<p>Minh is originally from Vietnam, and moved to Australia 8 years ago.  He is a married father of a four-month-old boy which now takes up a lot of his time.   He has previously completed an Advanced Diploma of Business Administration but after working in the relevant field found that the work did not suit him. <br><br>Spending a lot of time with computers when he was younger learning for school and studying a new language piqued his interest in information technology.  He is also fascinated by the ongoing innovation and development of various technology products, be that the constant change of mobile phones from the bulky items of the 90s to the comparatively smaller but more feature rich ones of today, or the increasing use of robots and artificial intelligence to make life easier and more efficient. Minh has no prior IT experience.</p>

							</ul>
							<p>Despite its limitations, as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test is the only one consistent between all members of the team, it will form the basis of the analysis of how such testing might inform the group.<br><br>All five members are introverts according the MBTI, which will likely mean that each individual will need to actively communicate with each other to ensure their point of view is heard.  The lack of any overtly extroverted members within the group will likely have both positives, such as it being unlikely for one person to be domineering and talk over the entire group, and negatives, especially in the event of a presentation.  A number of these MBTI types are also associated with perfectionism.  While an element of perfectionism can be a good thing, especially when it comes to group projects where it can be necessary to ensure things don’t “slip through the cracks”, too much perfectionism can hinder progression of the project if the team becomes fixated on less important tasks.  That all three types are considered to be dedicated and hard-working bodes well for the group as it is unlikely that there will be members who do not contribute sufficiently.  This also means that it is less likely that team members may develop frustrations with another due to a perceived lack of input.<br><br> Within this team of five people, there are only two that declared their “ideal job” to be the same one, with both Malcolm and Minh desiring to become software engineers.  Van, with his previous experience with Linux systems, hopes to become a Linux system administrator while Sisi aims to become a cloud engineer, which stems from her prior work history.  Lastly, Darren has listed his ideal job as a network engineer. Between the five jobs, Linux system administrator and network engineer have the most similarities between them with both dealing with setting up, maintaining and troubleshooting computers and the networks they are connected to, although they are considered to be at different levels and therefore require differing levels of experience (Ali, 2018; Fieldengineer.com, 2019).  It can be argued that the job of a cloud engineer can be similar to either that of a network engineer, as they can be required to both manage cloud network (Stewart, 2019), or of a software engineer, designing and implementing software to suit the needs of their client (Intellipaat Blog, 2019), depending on their specific role.  The role of software engineer can also be quite varied depending on what is required by the job and/or client, but generally involves designing, developing and creating various software implementations, either at the application or system level (Indeed.com, 2019).  Across the group, the majority have listed “ideal jobs” that require a moderate degree of experience beyond a Bachelor’s Degree.</p>
